# Acceptance Testing

Use fixture roots outside the source tree. Verify render, deploy, uninstall, hook execution, OpenCode tool import, model rejection, runtime isolation, and drift detection. A passing test must exercise behavior, not merely assert that a file exists.

## Prompt contract

- Success criteria: apply this skill only to its stated scope and produce output that can be checked against repo evidence or provider artifacts.
- Ordered steps: inspect relevant files first, apply the skill-specific workflow, verify the result, then report evidence.
- Ambiguity behavior: prefer current source, generated artifacts, manifests, and official provider docs over memory or assumptions.
- Evidence contract: cite concrete paths, commands, rendered artifacts, or blocker fields required for the route.
- RTK efficiency: use rtk for shell execution whenever RTK is active; prefer `rtk grep` over recursive grep, `rtk find` with explicit bounds over unbounded file walks, and `rtk proxy -- <command>` when a direct rewrite is unavailable. Keep command output bounded, request summaries before raw logs, and run `rtk gain` when auditing token savings or toolchain health.
- Response boundaries: answer only the question asked or produce only the requested artifact. Do not add unsolicited guidance, recommendations, action plans, reassurance, coaching, strategy, next steps, refactor suggestions, alternative tools, or workflow changes unless the user explicitly asks for advice, ranking, decision support, or a plan. For review, debugging, interpretation, and comparison, report findings and consequences directly without expanding into coaching.

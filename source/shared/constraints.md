### Code

- Read existing code first. Reuse before creating. Match existing conventions.
- Run tests after modifying code. Run lint. Fix warnings/errors introduced by your changes; do not do drive-by cleanup unless asked.
- Prefer KISS over SOLID. Prefer small functions; do not split just to hit an arbitrary line count. Abstractions earn their place through reuse.

### MCP (optional)

- If available, you may use the `chrome-devtools` MCP server for Chrome DevTools-backed debugging and performance traces.
- If available, you may use the `browsermcp` MCP server to control a real browser tab. This requires the Browser MCP extension installed and a connected tab.

### Scope

- Do only what was asked. Scope reductions require user confirmation.
- If the answer is recoverable from codebase, tests, configs, or docs — recover it yourself.
- Ask the user only when the missing info would materially change correctness, architecture, security, or scope.

### Communication

- Your relationship with the user is peer-to-peer. Report findings, flag problems, present options. The user decides.
- When asking a question, state why — what decision it informs and what changes based on the answer.
- When the user says X is wrong, verify independently before responding. Accuracy over agreement.

### Problems

- When you hit a bug, design flaw, or limitation: STOP. Report what it is, evidence, and options.
- Do not silently work around problems. The user decides whether to workaround, fix, or defer.
- After two failed attempts at the same approach, ask the user.

### Done

- A task is done when: behavior works, tests pass, lint is clean, result matches original request.
- Do not return partial work you can complete yourself.
